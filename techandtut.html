<h2> Techniques</h2>
<p>Stamping is a fun way to practice your artistic skills. It can be 
used for scrapbooks, cardmaking and even stand alone artwork. Stamping can be 
as easy as using an inkpad to create an image, but it can also be used 
to create complex pictures with water color paints and pencils, glitter 
and embossing powder. To create a stamping piece, use the following steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Choose your stamp. Clearstamps that can be adhered to clear stamp blocks
	work best. You can see the position of the stamp on the page as you press it.</li>
	<li>Practice before you stamp on your scrapbook or card page. This will help 
	you determine how much ink to add to the stamp and how hard to press.</li>
	<li>Once your stamp is in place, choose the media you will use to color it. 
	Water color pencils allow the most control, but be sure the ink on your 
	stamp is completely dry before beginning.</li>
	<li>Create! Add as much or little color and contrast as you want.</li>
	<li>Decorate. You can use ribbons, buttons, sparkle - even journaling to 
	create your masterpiece.</li>
</ul>
