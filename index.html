<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>Feeling unispired? Here are a few themes to get your creative juices flowing:
Bugs, Frogs, and Worms - creepy, crawly...and fascinating. Some of my best photos of my kids 
come from watching their encounters with butterfies, worms, beattles and frogs. You never
know how they are going to react!</p>
<h2>Journaling</h2>
<p>Don't forget to write it down. A picture is worth a thousand words,
		but sometimes you need to write down those funny experiences for posterity. 
		The stories are friends and families tell can be great for 
		inspiration, so give yourself a special space to write about 
		that Griswald Family Christmas.</p>

	<dt><h2>Scrapbooks for Beginners</h2></dt>
		<dd>If you are new to scrapbooking, never fear. There are
		many resources available to help you get strated. Here are
		a few things you need to know.</dd>
	<dt>Shapes and Sizes</dt>
	<img id="dcm" src="booksize.gif" height="200" width="200" alt="Scrapbooks">
		<dd>Scrapbooks can be big (like the 12x12 books) or small (like 
		the mini 6x8 options). 
	<dt>Photographs</dt>
		<dd>Scrapbooks are all about preserving memories. One of the 
		primary elements of a scrapbook is photographs. The good news is 
		you don't have to be an expert photographer. Even some of your worst
		photographs can make great scrapbook pages. Do you cut off the 
		tops of people's heads when you take pictures? Scrapbook those
		smiles and styles. Even blurry pictures can be reminders of those kids
		that never stop moving, so get creative.</dd>
	<dt>Other Elements</dt>
		<img id="dcm1" src="Extra.gif" height="150" width="300" alt="Extra Elements">
		<dd>You have the photographs, but where do you go from here? Some of the 
		basic scrapbooking equipment includes paper scissors, a paper cutter, adhesives 
		patterned and solid color paper. From there you can build with all sorts of 
		ephemera, such as ribbon, charms, stickers, buttons, brads and so much more.</dd>
	<dt>Get Creative</dt>
		<dd>Artists welcome, but you don't have to know a lot about design 
		to create great scrapbooks. If you still feel uncertain, there are
		lots of collections with prematched paper and design suggestions 
		to get you started.</dd>
	<dt><h2>More Advanced?</h2></dt>
		<dd>Check out some of the <a href= "techandtut.html">
		techniques and tutorials.</a><dd>
	<dt>Paper Tearing</dt>
		<dd>It's old school - but it's also a great way to hone your 
		crafting skills. Sketch out your designs and create your own 
		elements, no scissors required.</dd>
	<dt>Stamping</dt>
		<dd>Stamping has come a long way over the past few years. Water color 
		pencils bring images to life, and for a new effect use a water brush.<dd>
	<dt>Embossing</dt>
		<dd>Even an expert will find this technique a little tricky. It's all about 
		controling the powder. Then, just add heat. </dd>
