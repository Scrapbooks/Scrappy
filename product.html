<h2>Digital Die-Cutters: The wave of the future?</h2>
<p>Two of the top competitors in the digital die-cutting game 
include <a href="https://shop.cricut.com"> Cricut</a> and 
<a href="https://www.silhouetteamerica.com">Silhouette</a>. Both offer scrapbookers the 
ability to create 2 or 3 dimensional cutouts that are fast and 
relatively easy. </p>

<p>A die-cutting maching can be costly, the Cricut ranges 
from $149.99 for the Cricut Explore One to $279.99 for the Cricut 
Explore Air 2 with a few options in between. Cricut is known for its 
use of cartridges with preloaded images that machine will cut for you.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<img id="dcm" src="Silhouette.jpg" height="200" width="310" alt="Silhouette Machine">
<p> Silhouette offers the Silhouette Portrait 2 for $199.99 and 
the Silhouette Cameo 3 for $299.99. Because the Sihouette was 
designed to plug into a computer, it allows you to create your 
own designs as well as use downloadable designs.</p><br class="clearright">
<br><br><br>
<h3>Which machine should you choose? </h3>
<p>The Cricut is easier to use 
straight out of the box and it conitnues to add functionality.
 The Silhouette will take time to learn, but if designing your 
 own die-cuts is your thing, the Silhouette may be right for you. 
 Both come with a steep price tag, so you can still scrap old-school 
 with a pair of scissors, some paper, and your imagination.</p>
<h2>Tape Runners</h2>
<p>Adhesives are an essential part of the scrapbooking process.
Choose a tape runner that is comfortable to use and archival quality
(acid free) so as not to damage your photographs. Permanent adhesive
tapes are non-removeable. If you need to experiment before permanently 
attaching your photographs, consider a repositionable option.</p>
